## Test repo for structure
## audit folder holds audit profile
## remediate folder holds remediate profile
## cassette folder holds the execution environment

I named the folder for the execution environment "casseette" as a throw back to cart machines playing tapes. The audit and remediate profiles are the content that goes on the tape in a cassette and the cassette is what's needed to play that content.
